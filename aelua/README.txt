The core aelua code http://code.google.com/p/aelua/ which is in part a lightly
modified java port of lua 5.1 from http://code.google.com/p/jillcode/ along with
some appengine specific lua libraries and other bits and bobs to make developing
websites in lua and on appengine easy. This code is reasonably stable and should
be considered beta quality.

Look inside the mods directory for more information about what each module is
hoping to achieve and if it is a good idea to try and use it yet.
