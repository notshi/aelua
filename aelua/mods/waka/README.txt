A wiki and blog like module. Where page content can be created and edited online
with a full recorded history.

Unlike a wiki live edits are not allowed except by trusted parties instead
visitors can offer sugested edits that must be accepted by an admin to go live.

This is alpha and working but subject to revision.

here is a link to a live version with some example content in it
