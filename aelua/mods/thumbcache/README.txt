A generic image thumb cache. Any dynamic image can be read from the data store,
resized to the desired dimmensions and then displayed. With mem caching of the
result. This is intended to be used as a utility module for other modules that
need to display thumb nails or just cached version of user uploaded images in
their web pages.

This is alpha and seems to be working.
